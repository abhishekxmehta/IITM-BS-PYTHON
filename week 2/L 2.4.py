## in operator concept
## in operator is used to check if a value is present in a list or not

# print('alpha'in'A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores')
# print('alpha' in 'A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character')


# #chaining operators concept
# x = 5
# print(1 < x < 10)
# print(10 < x < 20)
# print(x < 10 < x*10 < 100)
# print(10 > x <=9)
# print(5 == x > 4)
